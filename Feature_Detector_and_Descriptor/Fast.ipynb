    "\n",
    "For each pixel $p$ with intensity $I_p$, consider a circle of **16** pixels around the interest point.\n",
    "![](img/fast_speedtest.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pixel $p$ is a corner if there exists a set of $n$ contiguous pixels in the circle which are all brighter than $I_p + t$, or all darker than $I_p − t$. (Shown as white dash lines in the above image). $n$ was chosen to be 12\n",
    "\n",
    "A high speed test was proposed, it examines only the four pixels at 1, 9, 5 and 13 (First 1 and 9 are tested if they are too brighter or darker. If so, then checks 5 and 13). If $p$ is a corner, then at least three of these must all be brighter than $I_p + t$ or darker than $I_p − t$. If neither of these is the case, then $p$ cannot be a corner.If it is, the full test is processed to ensure the interest point is a corner.\n",
    "This detector in itself exhibits high performance, but there are several weaknesses:\n",
    "- It does not reject as many candidates for $n < 12$.\n",
    "- The choice of pixels is not optimal because its efficiency depends on ordering of the questions and distribution of corner appearances.\n",
    "- Results of high-speed tests are thrown away.\n",
    "- Multiple features are detected adjacent to one another\n",

    "For every feature point, store the 16 pixels around it as a vector. Do it for all the images to get feature vector $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pixel (say $x$) in these 16 pixels can have one of the following three states:\n",
    "![](img/fast_equation.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on these states, the feature vector $P$ is subdivided into 3 subsets, $P_d$, $P_s$, $P_b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a new boolean variable, $K_p$, which is true if $p$ is a corner and false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the ID3 algorithm (decision tree classifier) to query each subset using the variable $K_p$ for the knowledge about the true class. It selects the $x$ which yields the most information about whether the candidate pixel is a corner, measured by the entropy of $K_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is recursively applied to all the subsets until its entropy is zero.\n",
